# Test Plan â€“ Inventory Manager

Our testing strategy ensures backend functionality is reliable, data flows correctly between components, and real user scenarios are accounted for.

## 1. Integration Tests

Integration tests validate how well backend components like the API routes, MongoDB, and item logic interact together.

**Objectives:**
- Confirm items are stored, updated, and deleted correctly via API.
- Verify correct responses from the server for CRUD operations.
- Ensure data persistence and structure in MongoDB.

**Test Cases:**
- POST `/api/items` adds a new item and returns correct response structure.
- GET `/api/items` retrieves an accurate list of items from the database.
- PUT `/api/items/:id` updates quantity or other fields and returns updated object.
- DELETE `/api/items/:id` removes the item from the database.
- Data changes are reflected correctly after each operation.

## 2. Regression Tests

Regression tests verify that existing functionality continues to work after new changes or feature additions.

**Objectives:**
- Prevent reintroduction of bugs after updates.
- Maintain stability across item and inventory operations.

**Test Cases:**
- Creating a new item still works after update endpoint modifications.
- Updating quantity does not interfere with search or delete features.
- Removing an item continues to function after importing export tools.
- Changing the schema (e.g., adding tags/history) does not break legacy routes.

## 3. Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests simulate full user workflows to ensure that the backend behaves properly across multiple chained operations.

**Objectives:**
- Replicate typical manager workflows through API calls.
- Confirm the full feature set performs as expected.

**Test Cases:**
- A user adds an item, updates it, then deletes it successfully through API.
- A test run connects to a clean database and completes the full CRUD cycle.
- All item operations complete within allowed time without errors.

## Tools and Approach

- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest for backend tests, Supertest for API route simulation.
- **Environment:** Test suite connects to a dynamic MongoDB database created per test session.
- **Test Scope:** Tests focus on `/api/items` endpoints for create, read, update, and delete.
- **Test Isolation:** Unique test databases are generated to avoid polluting real data.
- **Execution:** Run with `npm test` using Jest CLI with extended timeout configuration.
